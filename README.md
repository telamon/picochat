# picochat

**Picochat** is a miniverse bar that runs on top of picostack, it is the first of it's kind and will serve as a reference application for the framework.

**Picostack** is an experimental Web6 framework that focuses on contracts instead of crypto.

A custom coinless blockchain that uses a functional-consensus.

It dosen't waste energy such as PoW nor does it run corrupt same way as DPoS.
Boasting zero transaction costs it provides a means to reaching longer lasting decentralization.

The entire stack is written in pure ES6. The kernel is designed to live within a browser-tab without external dependencies, it's very lightweight.

A full node runs on a low-end user device without depending on a central service.

## Start

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Using as a dependency

```bash
$ npm install picochat
```

```js
import Kernel from 'picochat'
const k = new Kernel(leveldb)
await k.load()

// --or-- in future releases
import { kernel, useProfile, usePeers, useChat } from 'picochat/react-hooks'
```

Proper docs will emerge when the time requires it.
For now read the `blockend/`-source or just [ask](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/issues).
